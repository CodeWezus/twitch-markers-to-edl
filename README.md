# Twitch Markers (CSV) to DaVinci Resolve (EDL)

A tool for Twitch streamers and editors who use the stream marker feature and want an easy workflow for importing them into DaVinci Resolve. With just a few clicks, you can effortlessly convert your Twitch stream marker CSV files into EDL format and import them directly into your Resolve timeline for editing. 

This is my first Python project and was an awesome learning experience. As I become more skilled with the language, I plan to build more streaming-related tools, along with a website to host them.  Stay tuned and happy editing!

### ðŸ”§ Features:
- Import stream marker CSV files downloaded from Twitch
- Converts the CSV file into EDL (Edit Decision List) format which can be imported into the DaVinci Resolve timeline.
- Compatible with DaVinci Resolve Free and Studio
- Option to apply/remove the 1-hour timeline offset (for DaVinci timecode sync)
- Simple executable â€” no Python install required

### âœ… How to Use:
1. Double-click `Twitch Marker Converter.exe`.
2. Select your downloaded Twitch marker CSV file.
3. Select if you want to apply a 1-hour offset to the timestamps. (DaVinci timeline starts at 1:00:00:00 by default)
4. Choose the destination folder and desired name of your EDL file.
5. Import the created EDL file into your DaVinci Resolve timeline.
