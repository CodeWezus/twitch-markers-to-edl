# Twitch Markers (CSV) to DaVinci Resolve (EDL)

A tool written in Python to convert stream markers downloaded from Twitch (CSV) into EDL format for the DaVinci Resolve timeline. This allows you to easily import your stream markers from Twitch into DaVinci Resolve for editing purposes.

This is my first Python project so feel free to suggest any code improvements or optimizations.
